# About

A small project to try my hands at object composition in JavaScript.

## What's to come next ?
I'm thinking of honing this small game more and more as I learn. Here is a quick list of features I want to add:
- Removal of the chosen Pokemon from the pool of avaible ones for the opponent
- New moves and news Pokémons
- A better way to select Pokémons and moves than entering a name or a number
- Leveling up ?
- Items ?
- Bugs corrections (this nasty elifcycle on sigint...) and improvements in code quality
